Here's an improved and more structured version of your prompt for clarity and efficient implementation by your tech team or automation tool:

---

**Objective:**
Integrate *Teacher Resources* (games, films, and other materials) into each unit of all Visual English books (0A‚Äì7) in a fast and efficient way, similar to how the questions were batch-uploaded into slides previously.

---

### üìÅ **Files Location:**

All teacher resource documents are located in the following S3 bucket:
`s3://visualenglishmaterial/teacher resources/`

---

### üìò **Books & Corresponding Files:**

| Book    | Resource File                        |
| ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Book 0A | `VISUAL 0A - VIDEO FILMS GAMES.docx` |
| Book 0B | `VISUAL 0B - VIDEO FILMS GAMES.docx` |
| Book 0C | `VISUAL 0C - VIDEO FILMS GAMES.docx` |
| Book 1  | `VISUAL 1 - VIDEO FILMS GAMES.docx`  |
| Book 2  | `VISUAL 2 - VIDEO FILMS GAMES.docx`  |
| Book 3  | `VISUAL 3 - VIDEO FILMS GAMES.docx`  |
| Book 4  | `VISUAL 4 - VIDEO FILMS GAMES.docx`  |
| Book 5  | `VISUAL 5 - VIDEO FILMS GAMES.docx`  |
| Book 6  | `VISUAL 6 - VIDEO FILMS GAMES.docx`  |
| Book 7  | `VISUAL 7 - VIDEO FILMS GAMES.docx`  |

### ‚úÖ **Implementation Requirements:**

1. **Batch Upload Approach:**

   * Automate the process of embedding these resources into the correct place for each unit, following the same logic/workflow used previously for inserting questions into slides.

2. **Expected Output per Unit (in slides or lesson platforms):**

   * Teacher Resources section with:

     * üé≤ *Games*
     * üé¨ *Films / Video links*
     * üîó *External links or tasks if available*

3. **Lesson Plans for Books 0A‚Äì0C:**

   * In addition to video/games, please ensure that lesson plans are also integrated (if part of the docx file or stored elsewhere in the system).

Would you like me to help generate a script or metadata structure for automation based on the contents of one of the documents?
