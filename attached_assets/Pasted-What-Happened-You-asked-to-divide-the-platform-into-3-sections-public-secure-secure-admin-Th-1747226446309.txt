What Happened
You asked to divide the platform into 3 sections:

public/

secure/

secure/admin/

That structure is good. But hereâ€™s what broke things:

ðŸš« Problems Introduced:
Problem	Cause
Login not persisting	Server uses in-memory session (MemoryStore) which resets on restart. So your login disappears.
Admin route blocked	<AdminRoute> expects session data, but the app fails to read it correctly due to React context timing issues or session not loading on time
Too many alternate access routes created	Instead of fixing the original flow, temporary fixes kept stacking (/go-admin, /direct-admin, etc.)
Redirect loops / loading forever	When <AuthProvider> or <useAuth> can't read a valid session fast enough, you get stuck in loading

âœ… What Should Work
The only correct, long-term structure is:

Admin Dashboard Access Flow
Step	Path	What It Should Do
ðŸ”‘ Login Page	/login or /public/LoginPage.tsx	Authenticate using credentials (admin / admin123)
ðŸ§  Session	Stored in cookie (Set-Cookie)	user={username, role}
ðŸ›¡ Protected Route	/admin via <AdminRoute>	Checks role === "admin"
ðŸ“š Books Management	/admin/books	Loads books for editing
ðŸ“¦ Units Management	/admin/book-units/:bookId	Loads units
ðŸ“– Content Viewer	/book/:bookId/unit/:unitNumber	Loads lesson slides

âœ… What We Need to Do Now
âœ… Step 1: Fix Session Persistence
In server/storage.ts â†’ move from MemoryStore to using sessionStorage or fallback to signed cookies (or JSON Web Token)

âœ… Step 2: Restore Clean Routing
In App.tsx:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<AdminRoute path="/admin" element={<AdminPage />} />
<AdminRoute path="/admin/books" element={<BooksManagementPage />} />
<AdminRoute path="/admin/book-units/:bookId" element={<UnitsManagementPage />} />
And in LoginPage.tsx, after successful login:

tsx
Copy
Edit
if (user.role === 'admin') {
  navigate("/admin");
}
âœ… Step 3: Remove Redundant Workarounds
Delete:

/super-admin

/go-admin

/admin-direct

admin-login.html and go-to-admin.html
Unless you explicitly want a dev override for offline testing.

âœ… Final Clean Result
You should be able to:

Visit /login

Login as admin

Be redirected to /admin

Click through to /admin/books â†’ /admin/book-units/:id â†’ /book/:id/unit/:num

All without loading issues or broken state.
