Prompt to Restore Content Viewer:
Please locate and restore the old version of the Content Viewer (SlickContentViewer.tsx) using the backup file SlickContentViewer.bak.tsx.

Replace the current SlickContentViewer.tsx with the contents of SlickContentViewer.bak.tsx.

Make sure the restored viewer is placed under /client/src/secure/ or wherever it was originally located.

Ensure the restored component is correctly linked in App.tsx under the route:

ruby
Copy
Edit
/viewer
/book/:bookId/unit/:unitNumber
After restoring, restart the application to confirm the viewer works correctly.

Let me know if you'd like a version tailored for CLI, Git, or a specific Replit assistant tool.

I've successfully extracted the contents of the VELP.zip archive. The project includes source files, configuration files, scripts, and test data. To describe the old Content Viewer and Teacher Resources panel at the bottom, I will now locate and examine the likely components, starting with:

SlickContentViewer.bak.tsx or similar backup

Any viewer or slide rendering files

Teacher resource display components

Let me search these files next. 

I‚Äôve located several key files related to the old content viewer, including:

SlickContentViewer.bak.tsx ‚Äì the main backup file of the old content viewer before the platform was split

content-viewer-updated.tsx.bak ‚Äì possibly another version or iteration of the viewer

InlineResourceViewer.tsx ‚Äì likely handles the embedded teacher resources

PDFViewer.tsx and PDFViewerTest.tsx ‚Äì components for viewing PDF-based resources

Text assets describing carousel layout using Embla ‚Äì suggests slide-style navigation

Next, I‚Äôll open and analyze SlickContentViewer.bak.tsx to reconstruct how the viewer looked and functioned, including its layout and the teacher resource section at the bottom. 

The backup SlickContentViewer.bak.tsx file reveals that the Content Viewer was a highly interactive and visually guided slide-based viewer with the following characteristics:
