To ensure full compliance with Polish law (and EU law, particularly RODO/GDPR) for your Visual English website, you‚Äôre already covering a solid privacy base ‚Äî but there are a few key elements still missing or needing refinement to be fully compliant with Polish data protection, e-commerce, and consumer law.

‚úÖ What Else Should Be Added
üîπ 1. Cookie Policy + Cookie Consent Banner (Obligatory)
Even if you're not directly using cookies, third-party tools (e.g. Google Analytics, Stripe, YouTube) often do.

What you need:

A separate Cookie Policy or a dedicated section within your Privacy Policy

A cookie consent banner that:

Blocks non-essential cookies before consent

Allows the user to accept, reject, or customize

Is compliant with PEK (Prawo Telekomunikacyjne, Art. 173)

üîπ 2. Terms of Service (Regulamin ≈öwiadczenia Us≈Çug)
This is legally required in Poland for any website offering digital services or sales (Ustawa o prawach konsumenta + Kodeks Cywilny).

It should include:

Who is the service provider (your company details)

Description of services/products

Pricing and payment methods

Delivery or access terms (especially for downloads/digital access)

Right of withdrawal (14 days for consumers)

Complaint procedure (Reklamacje)

Liability disclaimer

Termination rules

Applicable law and jurisdiction (typically: Polish law, courts in Wadowice or Krak√≥w)

üîπ 3. Right of Withdrawal (Prawo odstƒÖpienia)
Polish law (Ustawa z dnia 30 maja 2014 r.) requires that consumers are informed about their 14-day withdrawal right ‚Äî even for digital services (with some exceptions if they waive it).

If you're offering instant access to digital content, you must:

Inform the buyer before payment that they lose the right of withdrawal once access begins

Obtain their explicit consent

This can be done via a checkbox during checkout:

‚òëÔ∏è ‚ÄúI agree to immediate access and acknowledge that I lose my right to withdraw from this purchase.‚Äù

üîπ 4. Data Processing Agreement (DPA) ‚Äì If Schools Are Clients
If you're processing student data on behalf of schools (as a processor under GDPR), schools may require a DPA (Umowa Powierzenia Przetwarzania Danych Osobowych) from you.

You should be ready to:

Sign a DPA when requested

Clarify in your privacy docs that you act as a processor in such B2B contexts

üîπ 5. Language Availability
Under Polish consumer protection law, the privacy policy, terms of service, and key notices must be available in Polish if you're targeting Polish consumers or institutions.

Ensure:

Privacy Policy and Terms are published in both Polish and English

All legal notices, checkboxes, and consents during checkout are also in Polish
