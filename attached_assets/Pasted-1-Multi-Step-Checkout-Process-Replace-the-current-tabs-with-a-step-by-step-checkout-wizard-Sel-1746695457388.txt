1. Multi-Step Checkout Process
Replace the current tabs with a step-by-step checkout wizard:

Selection Step: Where users choose books/units
Plan Step: Where users select subscription period
Summary Step: Where users review their selections before payment
Payment Step: Where users enter payment details
This creates a clearer path to purchase and helps users focus on one decision at a time.

2. Shopping Cart Integration
Instead of immediate purchasing from each page:

Add items to a central cart
Show a cart indicator in the navbar with item count
Let users continue shopping after adding items
Allow reviewing all items together at checkout
3. Visual Improvements
Add product images that are larger and more engaging
Include a progress indicator showing steps and completion
Use colorful confirmation animations when adding items
Show a mini-summary that follows as users scroll
4. Plan Comparison
Add a side-by-side comparison of monthly vs yearly plans
Calculate and display the actual savings amount
Show what's included in each plan with checkmarks
Highlight recommended options based on selection size
5. User-Friendly Additions
Add "Continue Shopping" buttons after adding to cart
Create a "Recently Viewed" section
Include customer reviews/testimonials near purchase buttons
Add quantity selectors for physical books
Show estimated delivery dates for physical products
6. Smart Recommendations
Suggest related units when viewing a single unit
Offer package deals ("Complete your collection")
Show popular combinations that other users purchase
Recommend books based on current selections
Would you like me to focus on implementing any of these specific improvements to the checkout flow?
