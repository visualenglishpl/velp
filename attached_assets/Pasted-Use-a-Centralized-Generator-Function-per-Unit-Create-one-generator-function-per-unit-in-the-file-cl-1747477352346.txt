Use a Centralized Generator Function per Unit
Create one generator function per unit in the file:
client/src/data/book1-unitX-implementation.ts (where X is unit number)

Example:

ts
Copy
Edit
export const generateUnit1LessonPlans = (): LessonPlan[] => [
  {
    title: "Introduction to Classroom Rules",
    objective: "Students will learn basic commands like 'Stand up', 'Sit down'.",
    materials: ["Stand Up Sit Down song", "Flashcards", "Video player"],
    activities: [
      "Warm-up song",
      "Command practice",
      "Game: Simon Says"
    ],
    duration: "45 minutes",
    relatedResources: ["video1", "game1"]
  },
  // ... more plans
];
✅ 2. Use Consistent Naming & Export Patterns
Each unit file should export:

generateUnitXLessonPlans() function

Optionally, a book1UnitXImplementations array

Make sure it's referenced in TeacherResources.tsx

✅ 3. Automate With a Template / Generator Script
If you're repeating similar structure, use a template like this:

ts
Copy
Edit
export const generateUnitLessonPlans = (unitTitle: string, resources: string[]): LessonPlan[] => [
  {
    title: `${unitTitle} – Main Lesson`,
    objective: `Students will understand the theme of ${unitTitle}`,
    materials: ["Video", "Flashcards", "Worksheets"],
    activities: [
      "Introduction",
      "Video viewing",
      "Group discussion",
      "Game activity"
    ],
    duration: "45 minutes",
    relatedResources: resources
  },
  // Add phonics/convo versions if needed
];
Then call:

ts
Copy
Edit
export const generateUnit6LessonPlans = () =>
  generateUnitLessonPlans("My Favourite Colour", ["video1", "game1"]);
✅ 4. Batch Create with Copilot / GPT + Copy-Paste Friendly JSON
You can paste all your lesson content into a prompt like:

“Turn this lesson plan into a JSON-compliant TypeScript object that matches this LessonPlan interface.”

Or:

“Make 3 lesson plans for Book 1 Unit 7 (At School) using this format: title, objective, materials, activities, duration, relatedResources[].”

✅ 5. Register Them in TeacherResources.tsx
Make sure in TeacherResources.tsx (or resourceRegistry.ts) you're importing and using them:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { generateUnit6LessonPlans } from '@/data/book1-unit6-implementation';

// In resource loader:
if (bookId === "1" && unitId === "6") {
  lessonPlans = generateUnit6LessonPlans();
}
