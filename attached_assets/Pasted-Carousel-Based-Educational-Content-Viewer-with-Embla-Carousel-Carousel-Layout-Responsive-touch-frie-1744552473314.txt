Recommended Tech Stack for Implementation
To develop this viewer effectively, I recommend the following tools and frameworks:

React Hooks & Context API for scalable state management

Embla Carousel for robust slide navigation

Framer Motion for smooth, elegant transitions

TypeScript for maintainable and type-safe code

CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS for styling flexibility and responsiveness

Lazy Loading strategies for improved performance, especially with large content sets
