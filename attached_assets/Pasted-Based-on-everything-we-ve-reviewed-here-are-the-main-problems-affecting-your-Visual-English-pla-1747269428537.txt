Based on everything we've reviewed, here are the **main problems** affecting your Visual English platform’s content viewer, especially regarding the **admin panel**, **question sync**, and **teacher resources**:

---

### 🧩 **1. Question Mapping Issues**

**Problem:**

* Units 1–9 in Book 1 were mapped correctly, but Units 10–18 had gaps until recently.
* Some units (e.g., Unit 4, Unit 18) still show:

  * ❌ Numbering like "Q1", "A1" even though it was meant to be removed
  * ❌ Incorrect or blank questions shown where there *should* be questions
  * ❌ Questions showing when the image **should not** have a mapped question

**Likely Causes:**

* Mixed `"unitId": "unit4"` instead of `"unitId": "4"` format in `qa-mapping-book1.json`
* Slide filenames do not match the `filename` or `codePattern` in the mapping file
* Fallback matching strategies overriding or misfiring inappropriately

---

### 📦 **2. Missing or Broken Admin Dashboard**

**Problem:**

* The admin panel components were split into `public`, `secure`, `admin` folders, but:

  * Some routes like `/admin/books`, `/admin/book-units/:bookId`, or `/admin/settings` don’t load
  * Authentication context fails or gets stuck loading
  * Some admin components may not be re-registered after reorganization

**Likely Causes:**

* Session not persisting due to usage of MemoryStore (temporary sessions)
* `AdminRoute` logic relies on a context (`useAuth`) that doesn’t hydrate quickly enough
* Server restarts wipe auth state due to lack of persistent storage (cookies or DB)

### 🎓 **3. Teacher Resources Incomplete or Misaligned**

**Problem:**

* Inconsistent loading or display of teacher resources under the content viewer
* Apple-style design was requested but not fully implemented
* Some units lack associated resource files (e.g., book1-unit4-resources.tsx)

**Likely Causes:**

* Missing or misnamed resource files in `/client/src/data/`
* `TeacherResources.tsx` sometimes can’t resolve the correct file
* Layout CSS may be outdated or overwritten during recent edits

---

### 🔗 **4. Embedded Media and Resource Links Unreliable**

**Problem:**

* Wordwall and YouTube links are missing or not showing
* Some units show only video or only games
* Raw .txt backup files (with iframes) are not parsed/rendered

**Likely Causes:**

* Resource data exists in backups (`/attached_assets/`) but not yet integrated
* Resource loader expects .tsx format, not .txt
* Embeds not passed into the `TeacherResources` component properly

---

### 🔒 **5. Auth Flow and Session Logic Weak**

**Problem:**

* Login sometimes succeeds, but redirects fail
* Protected routes (`/admin`, `/admin/books`) block access even when logged in

**Likely Causes:**

* `AuthProvider` is not initialized before `useAuth` runs
* Admin role is not saved properly in the sessionStorage or cookie
* React routing (`<Navigate />`) not synced with session state

| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧩 QA Mapping        | Re-audit `qa-mapping-book1.json` – ensure all `"unitId"` values are numbers (`"4"`, not `"unit4"`) and filenames match |
| 🔐 Auth              | Migrate from `MemoryStore` to a persistent cookie/session store (or localStorage bridge)                               |
| 📚 Admin Panel       | Re-check route setup in `App.tsx`, verify `AdminRoute` works with delayed auth hydration                               |
| 🎓 Teacher Resources | Confirm all `bookX-unitY-resources.tsx` files exist; re-style `TeacherResources.tsx` using Tailwind for clean design   |
| 🔗 Embedded Media    | Write a parser to convert `.txt` iframe backup into usable `.tsx` object arrays per unit                               |
