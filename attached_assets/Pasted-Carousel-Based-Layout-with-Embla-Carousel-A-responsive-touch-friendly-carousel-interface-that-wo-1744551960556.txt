Implementation Approach
For implementation, I would recommend using a combination of:

React Hooks and Context API for state management
Embla Carousel for the core slide navigation
Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions
TypeScript for robust type safety and better code organization
CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS for styling
Lazy loading for better performance with large content sets
This approach would create a specialized viewer tailored to educational content that balances performance, usability, and pedagogical features needed for effective language teaching.

Would you like me to start implementing a content viewer with these features, or would you prefer to focus on a specific subset of these capabilities?
