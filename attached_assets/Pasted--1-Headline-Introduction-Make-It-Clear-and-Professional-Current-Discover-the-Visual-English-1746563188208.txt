“Discover the Visual English Method”

Improved Version:

Discover the Visual English Method
A complete, image-based approach for teaching English to children aged 4–15 — designed for ESL teachers who want structured lessons, instant engagement, and minimal prep.

🔹 2. Teaching Philosophy Summary (Short and Relatable)
Built by teachers, for teachers.
Visual English was created by Izabela Buassa, an experienced English teacher, to solve a real classroom problem: young learners struggle with speaking English when lessons rely on traditional textbooks or translation.

The solution? A direct method that uses visual cues — images, GIFs, videos — to spark full-sentence conversation, without needing to translate.

🔹 3. Core Teaching Features (Detailed and Practical)
Use clear headings, icons, and brief explanation under each one:

1. 📸 Visual-Based Learning
Each unit includes 200–300 themed images. Teachers display them while asking questions like:
“What’s she doing?” or “What do you do in the morning?”

✔️ No reading required for beginners
✔️ Great for mixed-ability classrooms
✔️ Builds vocabulary naturally

2. 🗣️ Conversation-Driven Lessons
Each unit comes with pre-written question-and-answer flows, helping students practice speaking without needing grammar explanations or translation.

3. ⏱️ Minimal Prep Time for Teachers
Everything is ready:

Printable books

Flashcards

PDF slides

Video and GIF folders

Use in-person, online, or hybrid.

🔹 4. Lesson Format Overview (Structured & Clear)
Each 30–40 minute lesson includes:

🔹 Warm-up (5–10 min): Picture discussion or guessing game

🔹 Main Practice (20 min): Guided Q&A with visual materials

🔹 Student Talk Time (10–15 min): Pair or group work, games, roleplay

🔹 5. Age Group Breakdown (with CEFR Level)
Age	Level	Style & Focus
4–8	Beginner	Simple Q&A, vocabulary, visuals only (Pre-A1 – A1)
9–12	Intermediate	Extended answers, daily routines, present tense (A1 – A2)
13–15	Advanced	Grammar in use, discussion, written prompts (A2 – B1)

🔹 6. Sample Visual Activity (Optional)
Add a visual or short description of how a lesson works:

Example: In “Daily Routines,” students view images of brushing teeth, eating breakfast, and packing a bag. The teacher asks:
“What does she do in the morning?” → Student: “She brushes her teeth.”
“Do you eat breakfast?” → Student: “Yes, I eat eggs.”
