Location of Teacher Resource Data
Teacher resource links were not hardcoded per slide, but instead stored in one of two ways:

A. 🔢 JSON / JavaScript Data Files
A structured object like this was maintained:

ts
Copy
Edit
const teacherResources = {
  B1: {
    1: {
      1: {
        video: "https://youtube.com/embed/abcd1234",
        game: "https://wordwall.net/xyz",
        worksheet: "https://somecdn.com/ws-b1-u1-s1.pdf"
      },
      2: {
        video: "https://youtube.com/embed/qwer5678"
      }
    }
  }
};
B1 = book ID

1 = unit number

1 = slide number

This structure was parsed or imported into the content viewer.

🧠 2. Slide Context-Aware Rendering
Inside the SlickContentViewer.tsx, the component would:

tsx
Copy
Edit
const currentResources = teacherResources[bookId]?.[unitNumber]?.[slideNumber];
If resources existed for the current slide, it would display them in a “Teacher Resources” section below the content.

🧩 3. Embedded Resource UI Example
tsx
Copy
Edit
{currentResources?.video && (
  <iframe
    src={currentResources.video}
    width="100%"
    height="315"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowFullScreen
  />
)}

{currentResources?.game && (
  <a href={currentResources.game} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    🎮 Play Game
  </a>
)}

{currentResources?.worksheet && (
  <a href={currentResources.worksheet} target="_blank" download>
    📄 Download Worksheet
  </a>
)}
It supported:

YouTube videos (embed)

Wordwall or Quizlet games (external links)

PDFs or Docs (direct download)

📌 4. Where Was It Located?
The teacher resource panel:

Appeared under each slide

Had a "Teacher Resources" heading

Was collapsible in some versions (using a toggle arrow)

Had icons and buttons for each type of resource

✅ Summary Table
